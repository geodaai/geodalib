## 🚀 Installation

Get started in a flash with your favorite package manager:

```bash
npm install @geoda/core
```

Each package works independently, so you can install only the packages you need.

## 🛠️ Example

Here is a quick example of using GeoDaLib to apply Local Moran statistics on some example data:

```js
import {localMoran} from '@geoda/lisa';

// exmaple data
const data = [3.0, 3.0, 0.0, 9.0, 8.0, 8.5];
const neighbors = [[1], [0], [], [4, 5], [3, 5], [3, 4]];
const permutation = 99;

// call local moran
const result = await localMoran({data, neighbors, permutation});
```
